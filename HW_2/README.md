spikes went down after popping view controller

## Task 2
Based on your comments I've made changes to singly linked list. Now all checks are done, except Big O notation comparison. I listed some of them which
I could calculate their Big O(still hesitate to their validity). These are
- count - O(n)
- find - O(1)
- reverse - O(n)
